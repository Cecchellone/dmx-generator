
DMX generation code

Main DMX generation engine is in pollingthread.py. 
You can run this from the commandline, but need to set the serial port in 
the __main__ section.


The other files are a GUI based on wxPython. See https://vcansimplify.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/ultra-quick-guis-with-wxformbuilderpython/ for how to get started with wxFormBuilder. Most code is in MainFrame.py, gui.py is autogenerated by wxFormBuilder
