
DMX generation code in pure Python, works with most USB-serial interfaces. 

This is described in my blog post at
[rotormind.com/blog/2015/Generating-RGBY-from-Hue/](http://rotormind.com/blog/2015/Generating-RGBY-from-Hue/)

Main DMX generation engine is in `pollingthread.py`. 
You can run this from the command line, but need to set the serial port in 
the `__main__` section.

The `hsv_to_rgby()` functions described in the blog post are at the
end of the file `MainFrame.py`.

The other files are a GUI based on wxPython. See
https://vcansimplify.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/ultra-quick-guis-with-wxformbuilderpython/
for how to get started with wxFormBuilder. Most code is in
MainFrame.py, gui.py is autogenerated by wxFormBuilder
